	abstract = {The 2023 KNE-Conference showed the urgent need to discuss the consequences of the new legal regulations for nature and species conservation in Germany. At the same time, the constructive course of the event confirmed the great willingness to work together on solutions that consider both the necessary expansion of renewable energies as well as nature and species conservation. There was consensus that improved land designation and land preservation tools are of great importance. Discussions on environmental impact compensation contained pleas for an adjusted compensation system. In terms of data availability, there is an untapped potential that has gained importance due to last yearâ€™s regulatory changes.},
