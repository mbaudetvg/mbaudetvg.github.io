	abstract = {"This is an intro-level text that teaches how to think clearly and conceptually about quantitative information, emphasizing ideas over technicality and assuming no prior exposure to data analysis, statistics, or quantitative methods. The books four parts present the foundation for quantiative reasoning: correlation and causation; statistical relationships; causal phenomena; and incorporating quantitative information into decision making. Within these parts it covers the array of tools used by social scientists, including regression, inference, experiments, research design, and more, all by explaining the rationale and logic behind such tools rather than focusing only on the technical calculations used for each. New concepts are presented simply, with the help of copious examples, and the books leans towards graphic rather than mathematical representation of data, with any technical material included in appendices"--},

	abstract = {One potential consequence of increasing women's numeric representation is that women elected officials will behave differently than their men counterparts and improve women's substantive representation. This study examines whether electing women to local offices changes how local government expenditures are allocated in ways that benefit women. Using compositional expenditure data from more than 5,400 Brazilian municipalities over eight years, we find significant differences in the ways men and women mayors allocate government expenditures. Our findings indicate that women mayors spend more on traditionally feminine issues, and less on traditionally masculine issues, relative to men mayors. In regard to specific policy areas, we find that women spend more on women's issues, including education, health care, and social assistance, and less on masculine issues, including transportation and urban development, relative to men mayors. We further find that women's legislative representation significantly influences the allocation of expenditures as a larger percentage of women councilors increases spending on traditionally feminine issues, as well as education, health care, and social assistance, relative to other policy issues. These findings indicate that women local elected officials improve women's substantive representation by allocating a larger percentage of expenditures to issues that have historically and continue to concern women in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Elections are the key mechanism through which voters hold elected officials accountable. The partisan composition of local, state, and national legislatures and governments, in turn, influences key policy choices and public goods provision. Yet studying issues of representation, government responsiveness, and partisan politics across different levels of government, in particular at the local level, has been difficult. We often lack comprehensive, comparable, and harmonized election results at small-scale units such as municipalities. This paper introduces a new panel dataset of local, state, and federal election results in Germany at the municipality level with coverage for the past decades. Our data includes turnout and partisan vote shares for all major parties. We harmonize the data to address municipal boundary changes and to account for mail-in districts, providing researchers with a consistent panel of municipalities in their 2021 boundaries as well as corresponding municipal and county boundary shapefiles. Our dataset will facilitate new research on representation and responsiveness across all levels of government and how political dynamics have changed over time.},

            We investigate how female representation impacts policymaking using the example of child care and new hand-collected data on local council elections in Bavaria. RDD estimations (mixed-gender races for last party-specific council seats) show that an additional female councilor accelerates the expansion of public child care by 40\%. We also document an important nonlinearity: an additional woman accelerates the expansion of child care only in councils with few women. Council meeting minutes reveal that women can be effective in councils despite being a non-pivotal minority because they change “the conversation”.},
